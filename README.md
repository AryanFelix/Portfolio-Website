## How To Edit
If you are reading this then I will assume that you know something about code and want to make a resume website of yours then this open-source project may help you setup it to showcase all your creations without effort.

- Edit details in `index.html`.
- Edit `Profile.png` in `\img` with your own image.
- Edit `Resume.pdf` in `docs` with your own. Also change required fields in `index.html` accordingly.
- To edit the theme, change `--mainText`, `--subtText` and `--button` values in all the css files.
